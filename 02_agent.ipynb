    "That is a pretty great chain of reasoning! With this much information -- really just the same amount available to a regular Zork player, just [stripped by TextWorld](https://textworld.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notes/custom_env.html#why-do-we-want-a-new-environment) -- we can get a pretty good agent. It might actually have over-memorized the Zork patterns already, but we'll see how it does on the other games.\n",

    "The next step is to give it a visualization, I think. More interesting to watch that way. I'll wrap all this functionality up in a small command line script, so it can be played/displayed from anywhere. Then I'll grab a diffusion model and engineer a prompt for getting images, and visualize it scene by scene. Then, maybe I can go back to adding a memory system, a mapping tool, a long-term scratchpad, a memory, etc."

    "Okay, I've realized the reason this seems to work so well. It's passing the entire command history every timnea s the `input` tag. When I implement memory for the agent, it doesn't ever get incremented, because the agentg is trying to find the answer in one conversational turn. What I need insead is to have it converse with the environment, so that the agent can send its commands as responses and the environment can respond. That way it will remember the turns right, and we can tune the length of the prompt to be just the last few turns, or a summary, or both.\n"
